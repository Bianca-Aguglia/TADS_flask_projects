# Blog_rp

A simple blog built using:
- Python and Flask for the back end
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the front end. 

The 'rp' in the name stands for Real Python, as this project is loosely based on a tutorial from Real Python. Since I anticipate doing one or two more blog projects to better undertand best practices around blog building and blog functionalities, I'm using the suffix in the project name to distinguish between them.
